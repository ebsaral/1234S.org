**Logical Spirituality** is **a philosophical movement** project dedicated to exploring and describing the wholeness of nature in detail. Through this project, you will gain deeper insights into your own life and its connection to the world around you.

By seeing that every being is inherently equal and free in nature, you will develop a clearer understanding of yourself and others.

*Nothing here is strict.*
