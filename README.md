## Introduction

> [!NOTE]
> This project is currently being developed to be released soon.


Logical Spirituality is a philosophical project dedicated to exploring and describing the wholeness of nature in detail. Through this project, you will gain deeper insights into your own life and its connection to the world around you.

By seeing that every being is inherently equal and free in nature, you will develop a clearer understanding of yourself and others.

*As education spreads across the world, the name of this project may evolve — nothing here is strict.*

## Core areas you will master through this project

- Understanding why living beings become ill, and how to prevent diseases without relying on medicine

- Discovering how luck is formed, shaped, renewed, and dissolved within nature

- Exploring philosophy, psychology, sociology, and related fields better in depth.

- Reinterpreting historical events — both on a global scale and within your personal life

- Revealing the hidden justice embedded in nature

... and more.
