## Introduction

> [!NOTE]
> This project is currently being developed to be released soon. [View Progress](https://github.com/ebsaral/Logical-Spirituality/projects?query=is%3Aopen)


**Logical Spirituality** builds on traditional spirituality by uncovering the **unseen logic in nature**. It demonstrates how these truths unfold in practice through two guiding principles: **Interconnectedness** and **Justice in Nature**. Their relationship is explored through a *multidimensional* cycle of learning, with the **health of all living beings** serving as the foundation.
