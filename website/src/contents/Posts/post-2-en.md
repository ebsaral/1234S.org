Recently, I went for a drive to a lakeside spot to clear my mind. It’s a well-known place at high altitude, nestled among the mountains. After a few hours, I headed back, but got stuck in a long line of traffic on a single-lane road. At the front was a large bus, and I was slowly moving along behind a whole bunch of cars. Overtaking was really difficult because the road was so winding.

One car tried to pass, but had to pull back into the lane when they saw oncoming traffic. Another car also tried the same, but couldn’t get far. I found myself joking in my head like *“even I’m not trying to pass, what are you guys doing?”*

So I waited for the right moment. I trusted that I would feel it. When that feeling hit me after a few minutes, I began a long overtake (about 20 cars and the bus) that seemed almost impossible. I passed that entire line of cars in one go, even going through a short tunnel, despite not being able to see around the bends.

What made me happy wasn’t just passing the cars, it was knowing deep down that I wouldn’t crash or die. That certainty, that calm of the solitude in the car, was a beautiful feeling that reminded me I wasn’t really alone. What’s interesting is, I know this feeling exists in everyone’s soul. No accident happens *“just because.”*

Maybe one day, everyone can carry this sense of trust and inner knowing within themselves. Because honestly, I wouldn’t trade that trusting feeling I had for anything, not even for money.
