### Health

Our physical and mental health directly reflects alignment with nature's justice and the (e)quality of our relationships.

Positive actions, compassion, honesty, forgiveness, and support for others → strengthen organs, mental resilience, and overall well-being.

Negative or harmful actions → disrupt balance, weaken the body, and manifest as illness or stress.

Actions can be both inward and outward in any relationship. Your relationship with yourself is also important.

**Organ-Action-Consequence Analogy:**

Body organs function similarly to individuals' roles in a society or environment. Each organ mirrors how our actions align with natural justice. A healthy heart, brain, or immune system reflects actions that respect equality and freedom. Unhealthy organs indicate imbalance, signaling misalignment with nature's law. Every organ's condition tries to educate you as a natural guide. At some point, nature protects your well-being as a reward of your choices and you may never get sick again.
