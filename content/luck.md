### Luck: Opportunities and Talents

Luck is nature's visible feedback, encompassing both opportunities and innate talents.

Talents are shaped by the interconnected environment: supportive communities, mentors, experiences, and even challenges from difficult individuals or situations.

When we act better than those who harm us, nature's justice can reward us through unexpected opportunities, personal growth, or strengthened health.
